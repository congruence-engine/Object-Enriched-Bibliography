# Building an Object-Enriched Bibliography: Experiments in Linking Museum Objects and Academic Literature 

## Short Summary
This investigation sought to find ways of linking museum objects and academic research articles. It originated in a collaboration with the [ISIS Current Bibliography](http://isiscb.org/), and focussed on links specifically between museum objects and research articles relating to the history of the textile industry. The investigation developed a pipeline which combined the Named Entity Recognition (NER) model GLiNER with word embeddings as a way of establishing links between a body of scholarship and a museum dataset. An example of this pipeline is available in the [code folder](https://github.com/congruence-engine/Object-Enriched-Bibliography/blob/main/code/linking_objects_and_scholarship.ipynb) of this repository, and is also available as a [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VxZy1ltFRlc6VTF-cplSFYaMf4Hgmr7Y?usp=sharing). 

## Research Questions 
* What methods are currently available for linking academic texts with museum objects?
* How desirable is this linkage - to historians, curators, publics?
* What new perspectives/insights might be gained in the history of science and technology by facilitating this linkage?
* What should linkage be based on? How malleable should the parameters be?
